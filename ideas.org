* What do we want to do w/ a ENTITY?
** look at all its components
** change its components
** Run it
  - capture continuation at that point
  - capture input/output
  - isolate?
  - Could we have a main function and then set/get functions?
    - Might be better to have one "doorway" into entity...
    
** Print it in some way
* Need a default way for it to "run" when "empty" 
* Need a way to install "packages"
  - for instance a draw package, or time control
