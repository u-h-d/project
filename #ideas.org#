* What do we want to do w/ a ENTITY?
** look at all its components
** change its components
** Run it
  - capture continuation at that point
  - capture input/output
  - isolate?
  - Could we have a main function and then set/get functions?
    - Might be better to have one "doorway" into entity...
    
** Print it in some way
* Need a default way for it to "run" when "empty" 
* Need a way to install "packages"
- for instance a draw package, or time control
* ISSUE: when compose controller, how to reference component entities outside of scope?
- might have macro that lets you define func as raw datum and have env for evaluation...
- nested machines? do you have to build from bottom up?
- can we said macro mk fresh REPL and define id/val pairs and procedure and then we can work?
- maybe have controller take as args the components...?
- could have macro that where you define function that EXPANDS to a function that takes components as args..
- COULD use EVAL...
- OR, have a macro inside that takes a raw body and makes a new lambda and sets it as controller...
    
* Might want a place to put type check...
